## 💡 Project Goal

Rather than building a creative new service,  
the main goal of this project was to **gain practical experience by developing and deploying a functional web service** from backend to frontend.  
We designed and implemented the full user flow — from user authentication to account management — and ensured that all components worked together smoothly.
